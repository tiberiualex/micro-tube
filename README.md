# micro-tube

Just a project for experimenting with microservices Docker + Kubernetes + Terraform, based on the book Bootstrapping Microservices wtih Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform.

The code is supposed to be as simple as possible and with limited functionality. The functionality of the microservices is not particularily important.
